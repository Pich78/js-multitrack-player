Multi-Track Audio Player Component Specifications
This document outlines the detailed specifications for a JavaScript multi-track audio player component.

1. Core States
The component will operate in two primary states, with a clear distinction for playback control:

Play: The component is actively playing the audio sequence from its current position.

Stop: The component stops playback and resets the playback head to the beginning of the sequence.

Pause: The component stops playback but maintains the current playback position, allowing for resumption from that exact point.

Clarification: The public API will expose distinct stop() and pause() methods for these two behaviors.

2. Grid-Based Playback and Time Management
Audio playback is organized on a configurable grid, with precise temporal control.

Grid Structure:

Sounds placed in the same column will be played simultaneously.

Sounds placed in the same row (representing a "track" or instrument) will be played sequentially.

Temporal Precision: The component will leverage the Web Audio API for high-precision audio scheduling, employing a "look-ahead" mechanism (e.g., 200ms) to ensure smooth playback and prevent glitches, especially at high BPMs.

Grid Cell Duration Calculation: The duration of each grid "cell" (the smallest temporal unit) will be dynamically calculated based on:

BPM (Beats Per Minute): Defines the overall tempo.

Time Signature: Specified as numerator and denominator (e.g., 4/4, 6/8). This determines the rhythmic structure.

Subdivision: Defines what each cell represents (e.g., a quarter note, eighth note, sixteenth note, etc.).

Formula: CellDurationInSeconds = (60 / BPM) * (TimeSignatureNumerator / TimeSignatureDenominator) / SubdivisionFactor (where SubdivisionFactor is 1 for quarter notes, 2 for eighths, 4 for sixteenths, etc.).

BPM and Time Signature Changes: Changes to BPM or time signature are only allowed when the component is in the Stop state. Upon changing, the internal timing calculations will be updated, and any subsequent play() command will start from the beginning of the sequence with the new tempo settings.

3. Audio File Handling and Overlap
The component will manage audio sources and their playback behavior, particularly concerning overlaps.

Audio Source: Audio files will be loaded from disk in WAV format.

Audio Loading: Files will be decoded using AudioContext.decodeAudioData upon initial loading and stored as AudioBuffer objects for efficient, repeated playback.

Silence: Empty grid cells will result in silence.

Audio Overflow/Overlap:

If an audio file's duration exceeds the duration of its assigned grid cell, it will continue to play beyond that cell.

Behavior for Overlap with Subsequent Sounds: If an overflowing sound overlaps with a subsequent grid cell that contains another sound, both sounds will be mixed and played concurrently. There will be no automatic truncation or interruption of the overflowing sound in this scenario.

4. Component Architecture and API
The component is designed as a headless JavaScript module, exposing a clear public API. A separate test application will handle the UI.

Headless Component: The core component will not include any graphical user interface (UI). It will focus solely on the audio logic and management.

Public API (Methods): The component will expose the following methods:

play(): Starts playback from the current position.

pause(): Pauses playback at the current position.

stop(): Stops playback and resets to the beginning.

setBPM(bpm: number): Sets the tempo. Only callable in the Stop state.

setTimeSignature(numerator: number, denominator: number): Sets the time signature. Only callable in the Stop state.

setLooping(loop: boolean): Enables or disables continuous looping of the sequence.

addTrack(trackId: string): Prepares a new "track" (row) in the grid, identified by a unique trackId.

removeTrack(trackId: string): Removes a track and all its associated audio from the grid. Only callable in the Stop state.

addAudioToGrid(trackId: string, columnIndex: number, audioBuffer: AudioBuffer): Places a decoded AudioBuffer at a specific columnIndex on the specified trackId. Only callable in the Stop state.

removeAudioFromGrid(trackId: string, columnIndex: number): Removes audio from a specific grid cell. Only callable in the Stop state.

setTrackVolume(trackId: string, volume: number): Sets the volume for a specific track (0.0 to 1.0).

setMasterVolume(volume: number): Sets the overall output volume of the component (0.0 to 1.0).

Events: The component will emit an event (e.g., gridCellChanged or beatPassed) each time the playback head advances from one grid cell to the next. This allows external UIs to synchronize with playback.

Grid State Management: The complete state of the grid (which AudioBuffers are placed where, BPM, time signature, looping setting) will be managed and loaded externally to the component. The test application will be responsible for defining and passing this state to the component via its API.

5. Test Application
A separate test application will be developed to debug and demonstrate the component.

UI/UX: The test application will feature an HTML/CSS interface, styled with Material Design principles.

Functionality: It will provide controls for:

Loading WAV files from disk and passing them to the component.

Visualizing the grid and the placement of audio segments.

Triggering play(), pause(), and stop().

Adjusting BPM, time signature, track volumes, and the master volume.

Toggling the looping functionality.

Visually indicating the current playback position on the grid (synchronized via component events).

6. Error Handling and Audio Output
Basic error management and standard audio routing will be implemented.

Error Logging: Any errors (e.g., failed audio file loading or decoding) will be logged to the browser's console.

Audio Output: Audio will be routed through the system's default audio output device via AudioContext.destination. No specific device selection or advanced routing will be implemented in this version.
